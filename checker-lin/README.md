## Homework #2 (Thread Scheduler)

### Organization:
* This project aims to create a thread scheduler.
* There are queue, thread and scheduler implementations.
* This homework helped me to better understand synchronization.
* Different ways of synchronization can be utilized, perhaps getting a better
performance in the process.

### Implementation:
* Every functionality required for this homework was implemented.
* The queue structure was created using a linked list approach. It can be
used separately for other types of data as well.
* I decided to go with a mutex for synchronization, so as to not have
semaphores for every single thread.

### Compilation:
* In order to compile, we use:
```
make
```

### Resources:
* Everything provided by the OS team
* [Linux Manual](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/index.html)
